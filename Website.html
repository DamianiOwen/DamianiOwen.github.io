<H2>Umaine First-Year Student</h2>

Hi, my name is Owen Damiani. I’m a predominately Italian 18-year-old with a younger brother and sister. I’m the first in my immediate family to go to college, although im sure my brother and sister will follow suit. I was born in San Francisco California and lived there until the age of about four, when my family moved to the east coast to a town called Westford, located in Massachusetts. For the most part I grew up a Westford kid, going through the Westford school system until eventually graduating from Westford Academy, my high school. While I haven’t done anything spectacular this year, a few kids from my school managed to go to Italy for a 15-day trip with a group of close friends a couple of years ago. After being in Italy for just 15 days, I knew I wanted to go back as soon as I could.
My favorite sport is lacrosse, as it’s far more interesting than any other sport I’ve played in the past. I played throughout my entire high school career and had a great time doing so. Grade wise, I was an honor roll student for three out of my four years in attending the academy and always enjoyed the business classes offered by the school. With business in mind at the time, I came to the university with hopes of getting a degree in business, specifically marketing. I’ve always been the kind of person who can be in a good mood, and generally I connect well with other people giving myself the impression that perhaps a career in working with other people may be in my best interests.
